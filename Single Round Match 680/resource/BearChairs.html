<html><body bgcolor="#000000" text="#ffffff"><table><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Problem Statement</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><p>I guess you have never seen a bear eating at a table.
The reason is simple: bears don't use tables.
However, they may sometimes decide to sit on a chair while eating.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Bear Limak is a waiter in a huge restaurant for bears.
The restaurant has infinitely many chairs.
The chairs are arranged in a single long row.
In order, they are numbered using all positive integers: 1, 2, 3, ...
Chair number 1 is closest to the entrance to the restaurant.</p>
<br></br>
<p>A bear takes a lot of space while eating, and all bears value their personal space.
Limak knows that there is a universal constant <b>d</b> with the following meaning:
Whenever two bears sit on chairs, their chair numbers must differ by <b>d</b> or more.
For example, if <b>d</b>=10, you can have two bears in chairs 47 and 57, but you cannot have bears in chairs 47 and 56.</p>
<br></br>
<p>The restaurant just opened for the day and all chairs are empty.
During the day exactly N guests arrived, one at a time.
Whenever a guest arrived, Limak assigned them a chair.
Each guest stayed in the restaurant in their assigned chair until the end of the day.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Generally, guests don't like to be seated close to the entrance because of the noise from the street.
You are given a int[] <b>atLeast</b> with N elements: one for each guest, in order.
For each i from 0 to N-1, guest i came with a request: "My chair number must be greater than or equal to <b>atLeast</b>[i]."</p>
<br></br>
<p>When seating a guest, Limak always assigns them the smallest available chair number.
(That is, the smallest chair number that matches the guest's request and is at least <b>d</b> away from each of the bears who are already in the restaurant.)
Return a int[] with N elements: for each guest, in the order in which they arrived, the number of the chair where they will be seated.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Definition</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td>Class:</td><td>BearChairs</td></tr><tr><td>Method:</td><td>findPositions</td></tr><tr><td>Parameters:</td><td>int[], int</td></tr><tr><td>Returns:</td><td>int[]</td></tr><tr><td>Method signature:</td><td>int[] findPositions(int[] atLeast, int d)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">(be sure your method is public)</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Limits</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td>Time limit (s):</td><td>2.000</td></tr><tr><td>Memory limit (MB):</td><td>256</td></tr><tr><td>Stack limit (MB):</td><td>256</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Constraints</h3></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>N will be between 1 and 1000, inclusive.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td><b>atLeast</b> will have exactly N elements.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>Each element in <b>atLeast</b> will be between 1 and 10^6, inclusive.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td><b>d</b> will be between 1 and 10^6, inclusive.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Examples</h3></td></tr><tr><td align="center" nowrap="true">0)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td><table><tr><td><pre>{1,21,11,7}</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>10</pre></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><pre>Returns: {1, 21, 11, 31 }</pre></td></tr><tr><td><table><tr><td colspan="2">Here is what will happen:
